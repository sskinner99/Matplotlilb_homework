Analysis
Capomulin outformed the Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo in tumor volume reduction, survival rate, and lower metastatic site occurences. 
It was the only treatment out of the 4 reported that saw average tumor size consistently decrease over the 45 day treatment and averagen 
tumor size decrease overall. 

The average number of metastatic sites was nearly 1.75 sites lower than the placebo group and the Ketapril group. 
Capomulin also saw significantly higher survival rates over the course of the 45 days. They were the only group with a final 
survival rate of over 50% and a survival rate 37.5% higher than any other group.

Ketapril seems to have a positive affect on tumor volume with the tumors seeing slightly greater average growth 
over the 45 day time span than the placebo group. The Ketapril group saw an average growth of about 5.7% higher than the placebo group. 
This may or may not be statistically significant. The Ketapril group saw a slower average increase in metastatic sites than the 
Placebo group during the course of the 45 days, but overall the number of metatastic sites were about the same. 
Ketapril's surival rates are comparable to the placebo at the end of the 45 day treatment..

The average Infubinal group tumor growth was similar to that of the placebo group, but the average increase metastatic 
sites was lower over the course of treatment and overall. This group still experienced average growth in metastatic sites 
higher than Capomulin. The Infubinal group, however, experienced the lowest surival rates of the two other treatments and the placebo.
